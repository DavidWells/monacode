# Monacode

> A thin es-module wrapper around the monaco editor and prettier

Exploring the feasibility of importing the [monaco-editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) (which powers VS Code) and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) modules directly into the browser; aiming to make it _one line easy_ to bring a native like code editing experiences to web applications without a build step.

Ships with all the features usually found in VS Code out of the box: things like code hints, type inference, minimap, command pallet, multi-cursor select, find and replace, code folding etc.

In addition to these features, prettier has been integrated so that hitting `âŒ˜ + s` will format the code.

## Usage

> ðŸ–¥ Check out the online demo at https://unpkg.com/monacode/index.html

Install the module as an npm module and import it using the bare module specifier, or import it directly from unpkg:

```js
import monacode from 'https://unpkg.com/monacode/index.min.js'; // 976Kb brotli

// Create a new editor and attatch to the document body
const editor = monacode({
  container: document.body,
  value: 'const add = (x, y) => x + y;',
});

// Listen for changes within the editor
editor.getModel().onDidChangeContent((change) => {
  const newValue = editor.getValue();
  console.log(newValue);
});
```

## API

The module exports a single default function which accepts a config object as an argument. The supplied config gets merged with a [default config](index.js#L51) which itself is a subset of the options available to configure moanco editors. Some useful values to know include:

- `container`: an HTML element that exists in the DOM (or a `ref` if using react/preact)
- `value`: a string representing the initial code to be rendered within the editor
- `language`: a string representing what language the editor should try syntax highlight and hint for
- `fontSize`: a number indicating what pixel font size code should render at
- `theme`: a string identifier of the desired theme or a url to a theme json file

Calling the default export returns an instance of the underlying monaco editor. Find out more about how to interact with the editor by reading the [API documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/index.html).

## Development

Running the following command from the root of this project uses [`servor`](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor) to start a dev server, then open your editor and browser on the appropriate localhost url.

```bash
npm start
```

## Production

Running the following command from the root of this project uses [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) build the source to a single `index.min.js` file. Currently this process takes ~1second and results in an output file weighing 4.6MB (commpresses down to less than 1MB with brotli).

```bash
npm run build
```
